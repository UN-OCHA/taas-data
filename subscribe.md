## Words Matter!

Have you ever tried to find information about an event, but not been able to find everything you needed, because every place you looked referred to the event in a slightly different way?  Say, precipitation in the DRC vs. rain in the Congo?

Using mutually understandable terminology is vital to humanitarian collaboration. How do you coordinate with someone if you both use different words to describe the same thing? How do you find the information you need if everyone is describing things differently? OCHAâ€™s work on taxonomy-as-a-service will make this a thing of the past!

## Our goals are to:

* Improve common situational awareness
* Promote collaboration amongst humanitarian and digital technology partners by creating a wider and more inclusive understanding of humanitarian data and information

Our initial work will focus on shared vocabularies for disasters, organizations and geographic locations.
