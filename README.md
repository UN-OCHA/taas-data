# UN-OCHA Taxonomy As A Service: Data Exports

These are the results of running the code in the [TaaS repository](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/taas).

Visit https://vocabulary.unocha.org/ to see what exports are available, their sources, and further information.

## Updating this repo

- For updates to the `json` and `sheets` directories, please use our [automated jenkins workflow](docs/workflow.md).
- For all other files, send us a pull-request!

This repository is no longer used to maintain the website vocabulary.unocha.org. The only useful are the datasets (CSV and JSON). However, a complete review and tidying has not yet been completed.
