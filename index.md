![Image showing different words for pencil](/assets/images/pencil-image.png)*Controlled Vocabularies and Taxonomies for Humanitarians*

 Welcome to OCHA’s new site offering Taxonomy Services for Humanitarians.  The site provides access to controlled (human and machine readable) Vocabularies and Taxonomies through an API, that can be easily integrated into all humanitarian platforms, information resources and datasets with little management overhead for end users.

See our [Taxonomy As A Service guide (pdf)](/assets/files/taas-one-pager.pdf) to find out more about out what it is, why it’s important, and how it’s beneficial to Humanitarians. Vocabularies and Taxonomies complement the [Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL)](http://hxlstandard.org/). More information will be posted here soon about how we are collaborating.

The Taxonomies shown below are the first in a whole series of Taxonomies relevant to humanitarians.  [Sign up here to receive more information about the project](subscribe) and to be part of the dialogue that will further develop this service for humanitarians.
